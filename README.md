## Description
This is a TypeScript/JSX-based Tabris.js example project. The app shows Reddit posts, enables them to be filtered and to change the display mode. The subreddits are retrieved from the Reddit API and rendered by ListView.

The project extensively uses `tabris-decorators` extensions such as data binding, dependency injection, ListView, etc. It is installed in addition to the `tabris` module.

## Run
In the project directory, run the [Tabris CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli) command:
```
npm start
```
This will start a JavaScript app code server at a free port and print its URL to the console.
The JavaScript app code can be [side-loaded](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/developer-app.html#the-developer-console) in the [developer app](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/developer-app.html).

## Build
The app can be built using the online build service at [tabrisjs.com](https://tabrisjs.com) or locally using [Tabris.js CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli).
See [Building a Tabris.js App](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/build.html) for more information.
